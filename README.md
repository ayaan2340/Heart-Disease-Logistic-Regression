# Heart-Disease-Logistic-Regression
A logistic regression algorithm that classifies whether a patient has heart disease using 14 different features such as cholesterol levels and age. Pandas was used to preprocess and provide statistics about the data while scikit was used to create the regression model and make a prediction. The model had an accuracy of 83$ possibly because of a loss of usable data due to null values. The model uses data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease.
